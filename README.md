# Ana Judd Sample Project

## What's included:
- Four DB models
- Controller Actions for each
- Cron job to run daily reports
- very basic UI for testing

## What's not inclded: 
- Robust UI
- Thorough vaidations
- Error handling

## What would I like to improve/add?
- Some class inheritance elements (for example, create "items" that would inherit from the parent class Item, aka. Door, Window, etc.)
- Better routing
- Better UI
- Overall, more optimized solutions. 


I really enjoyed this project. It was fun to dig in and create something from scratch. I know the challenge wasn't to build something as complete as this. But, I got started and had a hard time stopping. I was really enjoying the process.

If I had more time, I would like to rework different parts of the code. Make them more "elegant" and perhaps improve performance. I would also add more validations on the models and find better ways to leverage the object oriented structure. Perhaps move some functioanlity up to the base class controller (some before_actions, etc. that would set "container" on the items or make querying faster). I would also add error handling.

Note: Generally, I would commit more frequently than I did in this project. Since I left this up and going throughout the weekend and popped in to work on it whenever I had some free time, and I often got pulled away quickly due to my kids being home, I didn't commit as much as I would have liked.
